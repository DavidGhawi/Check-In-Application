Within the given time frame, I was able to achieve the employee side of the application, however, I decided to get rid of the supervisor side of the application as the project scope was too large. The application is now focused on the well-being of the employee and allowing the employee to track trends of their own well-being, I was able to implement everything I intended for the employee side. When I ran into a particular issue, I referred to the lecture recordings on Panopto and online resources, which allowed me to achieve the employee side targets that I set out at the start of the development stage.

One thing I would do differently next time is create wireframes of the application and sketch out how the user would navigate through different parts of the application. Because during the development stage I decided to complete all the functionality part of the application and make sure that it functions as planned. However, when it came to styling and reorganising the application, I struggled with how each functionality would link with each other. If I had more time, I would attempt to implement the supervisor side of the application as intended at the start.
