The application is created to advance workplace mental health and wellbeing for employees. Employees will be able to check in and express their emotions via this application, giving immediate feedback on their emotional status. Companies may keep an eye on this feedback and get alerts for workers who might need further assistance or intervention.

With the use of this application, companies will be able to proactively detect and address concerns pertaining to employee welfare while also fostering a good and encouraging work environment. Employers may build focused treatments and enhance the general wellness of their staff by tracking and monitoring employee wellbeing.

The usage of this application will be especially beneficial for businesses with a sizable staff, several locations, and high stress working conditions.
