The application is designed with the goal of promoting workplace mental health and acts as a proactive tool for both management and employees. Through a simple interface, such as clicking on an icon like a smiling face, workers log in and "check-in" their present emotional state. The management is kept up to date due to this straightforward, fast feedback system.

Within the same application, a unique management portal allows real-time monitoring of this feedback. The system is programmed to send alerts to management when an employee's check-ins suggest the need for additional support. This ensures timely intervention and assistance.

The application also provides a set of analytical tools. These give businesses the ability to track, monitor, and assess the overall health of their workforce, supporting the creation of focused plans to improve wellness and promote a positive work environment.

This application is particularly beneficial for businesses with large workforces, multiple locations, or high-stress work conditions. It enables efficient access to wellbeing data, helping identify trends, patterns, and resource allocation strategies.

By leveraging a broad range of SDK features, the application aims to enhance employee happiness, reduce absenteeism, and turnover rates, and provide mutual benefits for both employees and businesses.
